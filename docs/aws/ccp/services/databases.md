| Relational<br>Relational databases store data with predefined schemas and relationships between them. These databases are designed to support ACID transactions, and maintain referential integrity and strong data consistency.              	| Traditional applications, enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), ecommerce, generative AI use cases (such as chatbots with Retrieval Augmented Generation, similarity search, recommendation systems, and more) 	| Amazon Aurora<br>Amazon RDS<br>Amazon Redshift                                                      	|
